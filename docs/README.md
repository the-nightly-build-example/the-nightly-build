# Documentation

The Nightly Build turns a configured press into a published paper. Start with
the path that matches what you are trying to do.

## Start here

- [Ask your AI](getting-started/ask-your-ai.md) is the shortest path from this
  repository to a published article.
- [Set up](getting-started/setup.md) explains the two ways in, what `nb setup`
  does on each, and the two settings only an owner can make.
- [Your first article](getting-started/first-article.md) describes what happens
  between asking and the live page.
- [Create your paper](getting-started/create-your-paper.md) is the two questions
  that make the paper yours, and the longer conversation for a paper of your own
  design.

## Operate your paper

- Operate: [schedule publication](guides/operate/schedule.md) and
  [verify the scheduled runtime](guides/operate/verify-scheduled-runtime.md),
  [manage your paper](guides/operate/manage-your-paper.md), or
  [update the engine](guides/operate/update-engine.md)
- Publish: [publish an article now](guides/publish/publish-now.md) or
  [revise a published article](guides/publish/revise-an-article.md)
- Customize [appearance and voice](guides/customize/appearance-and-voice.md),
  [furniture](guides/customize/furniture.md), or
  [templates](guides/customize/templates.md)

## Understand and reference the system

- Start with the [feature catalog](reference/README.md) for the complete map of
  supported capabilities and their configuration.
- Concepts: [architecture](concepts/architecture.md),
  [ownership and branches](concepts/ownership-and-branches.md), and
  [publishing and security](concepts/publishing-and-security.md)
- Reference details: [site](reference/site.md), [series](reference/series.md),
  [templates](reference/templates.md), [furniture](reference/furniture.md),
  [production](reference/production.md), and [delivery](reference/delivery.md)
- [Agent and scheduler integrations](integrations/README.md)
- Troubleshoot [setup and scheduling](troubleshooting/setup-and-scheduling.md)
  or [Article PRs](troubleshooting/article-prs.md)

These pages explain how the system works and which decisions are yours. The
skills under `.agents/` are where agents learn to execute the work, sometimes
autonomously and sometimes with you, depending on the skill. These pages point
at skill files by path, and your assistant reads them itself.

Files under `spec/` are production contracts for article-making agents and the
engine. They are useful to contributors, but they are not the user manual.
