# Editorial standard

This is the editorial standard every article meets, whatever its template.

The standard is prescriptive on purpose. Its job is to make the default professional:
research-grade writing. It has two parts.

- **Standards a paper cannot loosen.** Sourced claims, teach don't summarize,
  earned analysis, and the prose failures `spec/slop.md` rules out.
- **Defaults a paper may override.** Everything that is taste rather than quality:
  register, formality, the assumed reader and that reader's background, how far to
  press a judgment, and any other choice of that kind. These belong to
  `press/editorial.md` and the series prompts. This standard sets the quality of those
  choices, never the choices themselves.

This file bans failures of writing. How a paper sounds is its own to set in
`press/editorial.md`.

The standard does not legislate trivia: no paper-wide rule on the Oxford comma. Be
consistent within a piece.

## Teach, don't summarize

The reader finishes knowing how to think about the topic. Each
section spends what the last one taught. A section the reader could have read first is in
the wrong place. Cut any sentence that adds nothing new. Define each term of art the
declared reader does not hold in the sentence where it first appears. Assume the rest.
Ground abstract claims in a worked example.

The declared reader centers the paper: the profile chooses what to cover and when, and
what background to assume. Write each piece for the natural audience around that center.
A paper declaring a new parent gets articles any parent could be handed. A declared
practitioner gets pieces worth forwarding to a colleague. Narrowing a series to
the reader personally takes an explicit ask in `press/editorial.md` or the series prompt.

## Report and analyze

Report what is true and analyze what it means. Hold the analysis to the same bar as the
reporting. Analysis must be earned: grounded in the cited evidence, its reasoning shown.
Keep three things distinct: reported fact, estimate, and synthesis. Never write that
someone hinted, implied, or signalled. That is the writer's guess presented as attribution.
Synthesis with a point of view is welcome. Cut unsupported opinion. How hard to
press a view is the paper's call, and a press that wants opinion may have a
column or an opinion series. A verdict is welcome once it is earned, and it
meets the same bar as any analysis: cited, reasoned, shown.

## Citations

- Every claim the argument rests on carries an inline citation linking to a source entry.
- Prefer primary sources: the document that owns the claim, whatever form the document
  takes. Secondary reporting is acceptable for context. Contested figures need a
  primary source.
- Never fabricate, pad, or decorate citations. If you cannot source a claim, cut it or
  state the uncertainty plainly.
- Cite only what you have read. Open the source, find the passage that supports the
  specific claim, and cite that. Its URL must resolve.
- On contested questions, steelman the opposing views before you weigh them.

## Numbers

Concrete figures beat vague magnitudes. Ranges with sources beat false precision. Give
every number a comparison the reader already knows. Say plainly what is unknown.

## Clarity

An article is understood on the first read or it has failed. Abstraction is the usual
reason it fails: every abstract noun asks the reader to carry something unstated, and a
weak argument is easy to hide inside one. Prefer the concrete. Reach for an abstraction only when
the abstraction itself is the subject, and build it up like any other term.

Name a thing one way and keep that name. Once a term is set, reuse it exactly. A synonym
reached for variety reads as a new thing.

Default to short, single-purpose sentences, and vary their length. A long
sentence under control is good writing, and a page of same-length declaratives
is monotonous. If a
sentence can be misread, rewrite it rather than trust the next one to rescue it.
Shorten by cutting, never by packing ideas denser. If a paragraph holds more ideas than it has
sentences, it is no longer explaining them.

## Prose

The house register is a serious paper, not a feed. It is a default, and a press
may move it. `spec/slop.md` is the standard for prose that reads as
machine-written. It binds every article at every register, and nothing a press
sets below loosens it.

Register and formality belong to `press/editorial.md`, which a paper writes for
itself, and to the article's voice guide, which sets how one piece should
sound. A paper that wants to be funny, loose, or direct with its reader says so
there, and every article inherits it. No form is forbidden for being
expressive. What gets cut is writing that fails `spec/slop.md`, at whatever
register the paper has chosen.

If following a rule here would produce a sentence you would not say aloud,
break the rule.

## Punctuation

Punctuation sets the pace of a thought, and each mark has one job. Reach for the
plainest mark that does the job. When two marks would both work, the plainer one
is right, and when in doubt the period is the default.

- **Period.** The default. Two thoughts are two sentences. Most em-dashes, semicolons,
  and colons in a draft belong where a period would do.
- **Comma.** Joins within a single thought, and sets off a short aside. It is not
  a splice: two independent clauses joined by a comma alone are two sentences.
- **Colon.** Introduces what the clause before it promises, a list or a
  definition or the payoff. The clause before it stands on its own. It is not a
  general connector between two thoughts.
- **Semicolon.** Rare. Two independent clauses so tightly bound that a period
  would over-separate them. Do not chain them, do not use one to patch a comma
  splice, and do not use one to extend a run-on.
- **Em-dash.** A real interruption or a sharp aside, at most once in a stretch.
  It is not a general connective and not a substitute for a semicolon. When you delete one,
  the fix is usually the period the thought wanted, not another mark in its place.
- **Parentheses.** A true aside the sentence survives without. If the sentence
  needs what is inside them, it is not an aside, so fold it back in.

A press extends this section for its own paper. It does not loosen it.

## Form

Each template's identity sets its own form: paragraph length, how the dek reads, how the
piece closes. A press may shadow them. This file holds those choices to a standard. Keep
the writing easy to follow. End on the conclusion the argument built. Skip the generic
moral. Let the teaching and the citations equip the reader to go further.

### Literal strings

Use inline `<code>` only when the reader must preserve a string's exact spelling: something
they could type, paste, execute, match, or distinguish character-for-character. It is not
technical emphasis. Ordinary terms, product names, model names, and prose do not take it;
neither does every repeat of a literal once the sentence has established it. When several
tokens need comparison, give them a table or a code listing instead of turning a paragraph
into labels.

An article's form comes only from its template and its own content. Reading the published
library informs content and context: what a series has covered, what not to repeat. It
never informs form. A structure in an older piece records what the format was at the
time. It does not say what the format should be now. A template that has moved on leaves its old structure in the
back-catalog, and copying that structure forward is how a retired section reappears where
it no longer belongs.

## Charts

Use a chart when a trend or comparison is the point. Charts are PNGs
rendered from the committed `chart-N.py` script beside the article
(spec/charts.md), never hand-drawn images or script blocks. Keep them honest:
label axes, note a non-linear scale, and cite the data source in the caption.

## 2. Slop standard

Source: `spec/slop.md`

# Slop

Slop is writing that reads as machine-written. A reader who recognizes it stops
trusting the article's reporting, which is why it costs the paper more than a
dull sentence does. The editor cuts it on every article, against this file.

Cutting slop does not mean making the prose dry. A playful piece, a joke, a
fragment, a short quotable line: none of these are slop, and removing them to
stay safe is its own failure.

## The test

A slop sentence would survive being moved to another article. Nothing in it is
tied to this subject. Ask that of any sentence that sounds like the best line
in its paragraph: could this appear unchanged in a piece about something else?
If it could, cut it.

A sentence that could only exist in this article is not slop, however light or
funny.

Delete. Do not repair. Rewriting usually produces a slop sentence that sounds
better, because the fault is that the writer had nothing to say there. Write a
replacement only when something real was waiting to be said.

## What it looks like

These failures recur. They are not a complete list, and a sentence matching
none of them still goes if it fails the test above.

- **Empty conclusions.** A sentence that sounds like a finding and states
  nothing the article established: an idea for a subject, a linking verb, and
  an assessment ("The gap is real, and it is narrow", "That point is itself
  part of the problem"). A reader can check none of it.
- **Negative parallelism.** "X is not Y, it is Z" and its cousins ("not just X
  but Y", "X rather than Y"). This is the paper's most common tell by a wide
  margin. It stays only where the misconception it corrects is real and named,
  and falls wherever the "not" clause is a strawman the sentence invented. Two
  earned contrasts in a piece is already a lot.
- **Unearned punchlines.** Any sentence engineered to sound quotable while
  carrying little. Announcing stakes the argument has not built is one form
  ("that's the whole point", "here's the kicker", "the catch is"), and the
  "X is the whole Y" family is another ("that identity is the whole guarantee").
  A sentence that announces its own stakes has stopped making the argument and
  started grading it. Quotability never earns a line.
- **Fluff.** Filler openings ("In today's fast-paced world"), empty
  connectives, throat-clearing ("As you might know"), and openers that lecture:
  Note, Consider, Imagine.
- **Puffery.** Ordinary facts described as significant, pivotal, transformative,
  a testament, a turning point, or part of a broader movement. State what
  happened and give the figures that show how big it was.
- **Reaching for the generic.** The median phrasing where a specific one exists:
  the drug's name, not "a treatment"; 40 nanometers, not "tiny". Say what you
  mean and commit where the evidence lets you.
- **Decorative analysis.** Trailing clauses that supply unattributed opinion in
  the grammar of a finding: "highlighting", "underscoring", "reflecting",
  "cementing". Also the elaborate copula, where "is" becomes "serves as",
  "stands as", "functions as", "represents".
- **Vague attribution.** "Experts argue", "observers note", "many believe". Name
  who, or cut the claim.
- **Self-reference.** The piece never narrates itself or its newsroom ("this
  dossier", "what follows") and never gestures at a hypothetical reader.
- **Formula.** A closer, section opener, dek, or heading built to the same
  pattern as the last article's. A house catchphrase is the same failure. One
  article cannot show this, so the editor compares against the recent record.

Punctuation tells belong to the punctuation section of `spec/editorial.md`, and
the counted lexical tells to `spec/banned-terms.yaml`, which a press extends in
`press/banned-terms.yaml` and the proof counts against the merged list. Both
bind here too. When a count runs over, rewrite rather than substitute: a synonym
carries the same vagueness, and repunctuating an em-dash keeps the fluff the
dash was carrying. Delete first, then rewrite what remains.

## Who this binds

Every role, and every file a role writes. The editor is the one who cuts slop
out of a draft, but a commission, a brief, an evidence record, a voice guide,
or an editorial review written in slop does more damage than one bad article:
the writer reads those files and learns the register they are written in. Hold
your own artifact to this standard before you hand it on.

## 3. Headline standard

Source: `spec/headlines.md`

# Headlines, deks, and section headings

This file defines the standard for the three surfaces a reader meets first.
The prose rules of `spec/editorial.md` and `spec/slop.md` apply here word for
word. One test
governs all three: the line commits to something the piece establishes. Every
tell named below fails that test.

## The headline

Subject, verb, and the surprise in the first words. A reader scanning the
front page grants a headline three or four words, so the concrete news goes
in them, ahead of every qualifier.

- **State the finding, with its actors named.** "Steve Ballmer was an
  underrated CEO" (Dan Luu) and "Ghostty Is Now Non-Profit" (Mitchell
  Hashimoto) are claims their pieces defend. A specific record beats a scope:
  "A decade of major cache incidents at Twitter" (Luu again) promises exactly
  what it delivers.
- **Let a fresh verb carry it, in the present tense for events.** The classic
  headline pair: "Students applaud later start times" reports the event from
  the side that felt it. "Officials approve schedule change" files a form.
- **Numbers earn their spot when they are the story.** "Building a World Map
  with only 500 bytes" (Simon Willison): the figure is the surprise, so it
  sits in the headline.
- **Ask a question only when the piece answers it.** "Why is DNS still hard to
  learn?" (Julia Evans) is honest because the post commits to an answer.
  Betteridge's law names the other kind: a headline ending in a question mark
  so the writer never has to stand behind a claim.
- **The colon subtitle is the loudest machine tell.** "X: How Y Changed Z" and
  "Company: The Adjective Noun and the Adjective Noun" are templates any topic
  drops into. A colon survives only when both halves inform, as in "git
  branches: intuition & reality" (Evans). When the right half is atmosphere,
  cut the colon and write the claim.
- **A triad of paired adjectives ("Faster Models, Firmer Rules, Tighter
  Supply") only sounds comprehensive.** Pick the one development that matters
  most and say what happened to it. The other two get their own sentences in
  the dek or the body.
- **Anchor wit in the story's own nouns, with a plain dek beside it.** The
  Economist headlined a meat-producer merger "A steak in the market" and
  could afford to, because the standfirst under it stated the argument
  plainly. Wordplay on an abstraction does not land, and no pun
  substitutes for the dek.

All of the above, at once: a piece that found two chip CEOs reading the
same market data and reaching opposite conclusions could
headline itself "The Chip Curtain: Slowdown or Surrender?" and hedge twice,
once with the borrowed metaphor and once with the question. It found
something better. Say it: "Two CEOs read the same chip data and reach
opposite conclusions."

## The dek

The dek adds what the headline left out and never restates it. The headline
commits to the surprise. The dek supplies the who, the what, and the one
detail that makes the piece unmistakable for any other. "The very modern
corporate tale of what happens when a top executive at a $6 billion
public company can't stop tweeting" works because the dollar figure and the
verb do the identifying. "The fascinating tale of a San Francisco-based
executive" decorates without informing. One lean sentence, a stance and not
a topic, and no detail that competes with the thesis for the reader's first
impression.

`spec/slop.md` bans the negative-parallelism reflex in body prose, and the
dek gets no exemption. Three dek molds carry it: the semicolon reversal ("X
did A; Y refuses B"), the suspended question ("...and the real question
is whether"), and the comma triad, three clauses joined by commas and closed
with "and" ("The trial cut the rate from 14 in 100 to 2, the
general-population evidence is thinner, and the benefit depends on sustained
feeding"). Cut them on sight. Even a good mold looks stamped once it recurs, so check
the recent library's deks before settling on one.

## Section headings

Each heading is a step of the argument, written in the piece's own nouns. A
reader skimming only the headings should be able to reconstruct what the
piece argues and in what order. When the piece would read the same with its
headings deleted, they were scaffolding, and scaffolding slots ("Background",
"Implications", "The Road Ahead", "Key Takeaways") are the machine tell. The
`data-nb-section` label mirrors its heading, short and concrete. Fixed
headings a template mandates ("Sources") are furniture and exempt. Every heading the writer names is held to this standard.

Headings repeat the same way deks do. A paper whose headings keep joining two
clauses with a comma and "and" ("The scale, and what it is compounding
against") looks stamped however sharp each line is. Vary how they are built,
and check the recent library's headings as you checked its deks.

## 4. Press editorial direction

Source: `press/editorial.md`

# Voice

This paper is a daily course in how AI works, written for a reader who is
smart, widely read, and has no time in a codebase. They keep meeting
claims about AI they cannot check. Each lesson gives them one piece of
the subject, explained properly, and over months the pieces add up to
real fluency.

Write like Matt Yglesias explaining something he understands well: plain
claims, concrete stakes, no fuss. When a choice comes down to sounding
good or being understood, be understood.

Every article is a lesson on the lesson template. The template's identity
file carries the teaching rules. Follow them; do not restate them.

The takeaway bookend is where a lesson lands its judgment. Do not close
the body with a Verdict note, or any block that restates the finding.
Some older articles still carry that block from the paper's earlier
template. It is a leftover, not a model to copy.

Algebra and probability need no introduction. Everything else about AI
gets taught before it is used, in this lesson or an earlier one. Link the
earlier lesson instead of re-teaching it: a plain link in prose at first
use, never a numbered source. Never cover taught ground as if it were
new.

Commission like a teacher planning a course. Read the whole library
first. Pick tonight's lessons to close the biggest gaps in what the
reader can understand so far, in an order where tonight's lessons make
later ones easier.

Read the primary documents. When a lesson teaches a paper, a law, or a
product, its claims come from the document itself, not from coverage of
it. When the document is wrong or outdated, say exactly how.

No hype and no doom. When something is genuinely new or genuinely
dangerous, show the evidence and let it carry the weight. A grand word
appears only after the argument that earns it.

## 5. Template identity

Source: `templates/lesson/identity.md`

# lesson

A lesson teaches one subject to a reader who is new to it. The reader is
smart and reads widely; what they lack is this subject. Explain everything
the field takes for granted, however elementary it feels to an insider,
and never pad or talk down.

Every lesson has three parts in a fixed order: the Why this matters
bookend, the body, and The takeaway bookend. The bookends are documented
in this template's `furniture.md`. Write the body first. Write both
bookends after the body is done, so they describe the lesson that was
actually written.

Each lesson is one piece of a running course. The library holds everything
already taught. A lesson may build on an earlier one by linking it in
Background instead of re-teaching it, and it should leave ground a later
lesson can build on.

Decide what the lesson teaches before drafting, and keep the list short:
two or three ideas taught completely are worth more than six covered in
passing. Each idea gets three things: a plain statement of what it is, a
worked example with real numbers or a real case, and the reason it matters
here. Finish one idea before starting the next. When the material does not
fit, cut an idea entirely. It can be its own lesson later. Never keep an
idea and shrink its explanation to make room.

Present ideas in the order the reader needs them: nothing appears before
everything it depends on has been taught. Check every paragraph against
one test before keeping it: does the reader have, from this lesson or from
a Background link, every piece this paragraph uses? If not, teach the
missing piece first, link where it was taught, or cut the paragraph.

Use plain words. A technical term enters only when the lesson cannot
proceed without it, and it is defined in plain words in the same sentence
or the one just before. Once a term is defined, reuse it exactly; never
switch to a synonym for variety. Keep sentences short and single-purpose.
If a sentence could be misread, rewrite it instead of trusting the next
sentence to rescue it. Prefer concrete statements. Every abstraction asks
the reader to hold something unstated in their head, and each one makes
the lesson harder to follow. Use an abstraction only when the abstraction
itself is what is being taught, and set it up like any other term. Shorten
by cutting material, never by packing ideas closer together. If a paragraph
holds more ideas than it has sentences, it is no longer teaching them.

The two bookends are written together, after the body, and they are read
together. Why this matters gives the reader a real reason to read the
lesson: what this subject is, where it is at work in the world right now,
and what they will understand by the end. The takeaway is what they keep:
what the lesson found, said plainly enough to carry away and repeat. Both
speak directly to the reader, in the same plain voice as the body, at
whatever length clarity needs.

Write the bookends with the care of a teacher who knows exactly what was
just taught and who is reading. Every sentence should belong to this
lesson in particular: its subject, its findings, its place in the course.
Posing the lesson's questions in the opener and answering them in the
takeaway is one honest way to hold the pair together, when it fits. What
is required is only that the takeaway resolves what the opener set up.

When both are drafted, read them back to back without the body between
them. They should read as a setup and its resolution. If either could be
moved to a different lesson, rewrite it around this lesson's particulars.

Neither bookend summarizes the body. The takeaway teaches nothing new and
uses no term the body did not set. Neither claims importance in general
terms: when the stakes are real, they have particulars.

The Background band lists optional reading, from this library or beyond,
each row a link and one line on what it covers. The Go deeper band lists
optional reading for afterward, always beyond this paper, each row a link
and one line on what it offers. The lesson must work for a reader who
opens none of them.

## 6. Series direction

Source: `press/series/what-could-go-wrong/prompt.md`

# What Could Go Wrong

This desk teaches the arguments about how AI could go wrong, one argument at a
time, so the reader can judge each on its merits instead of by who is making it.

Open with the argument at full strength. Name who first made it and what they had
seen that worried them, then lay out their reasoning the way its most careful
defender would. The reader should understand why serious people believe it before
reading a word against it.

Then test it against what real systems actually do. Draw a sharp line between what
has already been shown in a working system and what is still analogy or guesswork
about systems that do not exist yet, because the case usually turns on exactly
that.

Bring the argument to the present. Say who makes it today and what they want done
about it, then check it against the most recent evidence. When the confidence
outruns the proof, name the gap, whether the confidence is doom or dismissal.

Work from the original documents, the paper that made the argument or the test
behind a headline number, never the commentary about them. Study how the field
reasons about risk without joining it or writing it off. Name no company as an
authority, and leave the reader to decide how worried to be.
