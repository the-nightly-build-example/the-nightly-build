"""The public command is a thin, checkout-owned facade over existing tools.

These tests keep the facade honest: every advertised command must resolve
inside the trusted checkout instead of relying on a global installation. The
root-launcher check also catches environment or packaging drift that unit tests
of the dispatcher alone would miss.
